The obligatory "fish out of water" scene, in which the principals are briefly slowed down by a banal everyday event, occurs during a child"s birthday party. The actual villain, whose identity is never in doubt (Hitchcock made thrillers, not mysteries) is played by George Curzon, who suffers from a twitching eye. Curzon"s revelation during an elaborate nightclub sequence is a Hitchcockian tour de force, the sort of virtuoso sequence taken for granted in these days of flexible cameras and computer enhancement, but which in 1937 took a great deal of time, patience and talent to pull off. Released in the US as The Girl Was Young, Young and Innocent was based on a novel by Josephine Tey.	3.824884	/8teH96d4Hcg1BWwCePXcuHrcYxw.jpg	[{"name": "Gaumont British Picture Corporation", "id": 4978}]	[{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}]	1937-11-01	0.0	83.0	[{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}]	Released	A Brilliant Melodrama	Young and Innocent	FALSE	6.8	42.0

It premiered at Loew"s State Theatre in New York City on November 18, 1959. The movie"s reputation as a classic is primarily based on two spectacular action sequences:  the great chariot race and a Roman naval battle, along with lavish production values and strong performances.  The plot of Ben Hur revolves around a Jewish prince who is betrayed and sent into slavery by a Roman friend and how he regains his freedom and comes back for revenge. However, instead he finds redemption in Christ, the theme is ultimately about being saved in the Christian sense.  The film went on to win a record of eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Charlton Heston as Ben Hur). This record-setting Oscars sweep has since been equaled by Titanic in 1998 and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in 2004, but never broken.	14.319743	/syPMBvvZsADTTRu3UKuxO1Wflq.jpg	[{"name": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)", "id": 8411}]	[{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}]	1959-12-26	1.469E8	212.0	[{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}]	Released	The entertainment experience of a lifetime.

He plays Lt. Bud Wilozek, one of a group of veterans recovering in the paraplegic ward of a hospital in his hometown. His former fianc챕e, Ellen (Teresa Wright), explains to his physician, Dr. Brock (Everett Sloane), her concern about his isolation and apparent depression since he has broken their engagment and refuses to see her. He counsels her to be patient, but when he decides to broach the issue with Bud, the embittered patient reacts angrily to the doctor"s intrusiveness, and continues to refuse to see Ellen. The doctor cajoles the withdrawn paraplegic into the life of the ward, where fellow patients begin to pull Bud out of his spiritual miasma. At length, his sense of hope starts to return, and after seeing Ellen for the first time in months, he begins to contemplate the possibility of marriage.	5.670881	/hZERsmBTJZzYIe65PRN8agy1HC4.jpg	[{"name": "Stanley Kramer Productions", "id": 893}]	[{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}]	1950-07-20	0.0	85.0	[{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa챰ol"}]	Released	A completely new experience between men and women!

Schtonk! is a farce of the actual events of 1983, when Germany"s Stern magazine published, with great fanfare, 60 volumes of the alleged diaries of Adolf Hitler ??which two weeks later turned out to be entirely fake.  Fritz Knobel (based on real-life forger Konrad Kujau) supports himself by faking and selling Nazi memorabilia. When Knobel writes and sells a volume of Hitler"s (nonexistent) diaries, he thinks it"s just another job.  When sleazy journalist Hermann Willi챕 learns of the diaries, however, he quickly realizes their potential value... and Knobel is quickly in over his head. As the pressure builds and Knobel is forced to deliver more and more volumes of the fake diaries, he finds himself acting increasingly like the man whose life he is rewriting. The film is a romping and hilarious satire, poking fun not only at the events and characters involved in the hoax (who are only thinly disguised in the film), but at the discomfort Germany has with its difficult past.	0.865615	/nhcbyqalhtDbbhnoKCYZdtOIRHk.jpg	[{"name": "Bavaria Film", "id": 1704}, {"name": "Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR)", "id": 7025}]	[{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}]	1992-03-12	0.0	115.0	[{"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}]	Released	One of the first funny german look at its past.

However, the two coworkers become at odds over Ot챠k"s inability to perform even the simplest tasks. P찼vek demands that Ot챠k be transferred to assist another driver, who happens to be a choleric and suspicious man named Turek (Turk in Czech).

With the arrival of Pele, the Cosmos became a hit  and the players became the toast of the town, earning their own private table at Studio 54. A number of other international soccer stars were soon lured to the Cosmos, including Franz Beckenbauer, Rodney Marsh, and Carlos Alberto, but with the turn of the decade, the team began losing favor with fans and folded in 1985.	0.110813	/mYpgwxTLhCTHoA0LXyRAYhTcpUi.jpg	[]	[]	2006-01-01	0.0	97.0	[{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}]	Released	The untold story of the team that had America at its feet.

He can also rely upon a network of unusual personal contacts, some dating back to the troubled years preceding WWII.

The band unwisely selected the Hells Angels to provide security, and the bikers resorted to violence to keep the stoned, restless, and often naked crowd in line. The result: dozens of injuries and the on-screen stabbing of a young black man (during "Sympathy for the Devil") by one of the concert"s staff security.

Feuillade?셲 well-meaning response to this brow-beating was another serial, the 12-part epic entitled Judex. The Plot: When his family is ruined by the unscrupulous banker Favraux, Jacques de Tremeuse resolves to bring him to justice. Adopting a disguise and the name Judex, he captures the crooked banker and takes him to his secret lair. Learning of Favraux?셲 dishonest ways, his daughter Jacqueline gives away his wealth when she learns of his death.

Since all her architects are either busy otherwise or too conservative in style, this ambivalent honor falls to Edifis. He is to build the palace and be covered in gold or, if not, his fate is to be eaten by crocodiles. Edifis calls upon an old friend to help him out: The fabulous Druid Getafix from Gaul, who brews a fantastic potion that gives supernatural strength. In order to help and protect the old Druid, Asterix and Obelix accompany him on his journey to Egypt.

In another of his "mad doctor" roles, Paul Wegener plays Professor Brinken, sociopathic scientist who combines the genes of an executed murderer with those of a prostitute. The result is a beautiful young woman named Alraune (Brigitte Helm), who is incapable of feeling any real emotions -- least of all guilt or regret. Upon attaining adulthood, Alraune sets about to seduce and destroy every male who crosses her path. Ultimately, Professor Brinken is hoist on his own petard when he falls hopelessly in love with Alraune himself. Alraune was remade in 1930, with Brigitte Helm repeating her role, and again in 1951, with Hildegarde Knef as the "heroine" and Erich von Stroheim as her misguided mentor.	1.405597	/nQ86wagyaAOF9KgsxQKUAHYlhCZ.jpg	[{"name": "Amalia Film GmbH", "id": 15193}]	[{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}]	1928-01-25	0.0	108.0	[]	Released		A Daughter Of Destiny	FALSE	7.8	4.0
